## 1. Baseline Purpose

1. Capture pre-refactor complexity and import graph state.
2. Provide before/after evidence for audit and migration verification.

3. Baseline served as Wave 0 guardrail input for later boundary checks.

## 3. How to Use This Baseline

1. Use only for historical comparison.
2. Do not treat baseline import graph as target architecture.
3. For active architecture rules, refer to `docs/README.md` and canonical guidelines.
