# Documentation Index
Date: 2026-02-13

This index defines document authority and usage.

## 1. Canonical (Active, Normative)

Use these as the single source of truth for current development rules:

1. `docs/clean-architecture-engineering-guideline.md`
2. `docs/backend-guideline.md`
3. `docs/frontend-guideline.md`
4. `docs/agent-layer-responsibility-and-naming-guideline.md`
5. `docs/fundamental-reference-architecture.md`

## 2. Working Assessment (Current Snapshot)

Useful for current state understanding, but subordinate to canonical rules:

1. `docs/agent-cross-review-2026-02-13.md`
2. `docs/refactor-workstreams-progress-2026-02-13.md`
3. `docs/legacy-code-elimination-plan-2026-02-16.md`
4. `docs/legacy-code-audit-register-2026-02-16.md`

## 3. Historical (Non-Normative, Audit Trace)

These files preserve migration history and may contain old file names or pre-cutover structure:

1. `docs/clean-architecture-agent-workflow-blueprint.md`
2. `docs/fullstack-change-control-playbook.md`
3. `docs/sub-agent-boundary-audit-2026-02-13.md`
4. `docs/archive/README.md`

## 4. Interpretation Rules

1. If a historical doc conflicts with canonical docs, canonical docs win.
2. Do not implement new behavior from historical documents directly.
3. Update this index whenever document authority changes.
